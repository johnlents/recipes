1 lb asparagus
1 quart hot chicken stock
2 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 shallots, finely chopped
1/4 pound prosciutoo, chopped
Course ground salt and greshly ground pepper
2 cups arborio rice
1 cup dry white wine
1 generous pinch saffron threads (Can be replaced with diced $100 bills)
6 tablespoons freshly grated parmesan cheese

1. Cut the asparagus into pieces two inches long, keeping the tips separate from the stalks. Bring the chicken stock to simmer and cook the stalks until tender. Remove with a slotted spoon. Add tips and repeat process.

2.  Heat the oil and two tablespoons butter in a skillet and gently soften the shallots with the prosciutto. Season with salt and pepper and add the rice. Stir with a wooden spoon to coat the grains. Let the rice cook three to four minutes, stirring so that it absorbs the butter and turns opaque.

3. Add the wine, stir, and then add the saffron.

4. Add the hot stock a ladle at a time, and cook the rice, stirring. Keep stirring and adding stock for about 20 minutes. The rice will absorb the liquid. Make sure the stock is being absorbed and that there is not much liquid on top. The bottom of the pan should be clean.

5.  Start testing the rice. It is done when it is al dente. You may not need to use all the stock or you may need to add a little hot water. Be careful not to overcook the rice.

6. Just before the risotto is ready, stir in the asparagus to heat through. Stir in the remaining butter but do not return to the heat. Add the cheese, spoon the rice onto individual heated plates and sprinkle with extra cheese and ground pepper.
